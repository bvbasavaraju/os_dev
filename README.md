Theoritical knowledge is good, but getting hands durty to get practicle knowledge is always Better!

This repository is to create an operating system from scratch. Its not an easy task and it cannot be completed in few days. It might take year(s) together to even have something working. 

I have more than 10 years of IT experience and I do know the operating system and its functionality. Till now its theoritcal knowedge now, I am trying to understand it by writing one.

I believe in **Reinventing Wheel** to learn something!

If anyone like to contribute, thank you in advance. I am not sure from when anybody can contribute, If you wish to please mail me on which module you would like to contribute.
If you find any bug, please do report!

To start with, I am planning to write using assembly, C and C++! As I am familiar with these, it only makes sense to use these languages. And C is the most preferred language for writing OS! I will use C only where it is necessary, otherwise I will try to keep it C++.
